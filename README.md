# DSA & Competitive Programming — Continuing the Journey

This repository tracks my ongoing practice in **Data Structures, Algorithms, and Competitive Programming**.

I initially started a few years ago using **Python**, solving problems across platforms such as **Codeforces**, **LeetCode**, **Open Kattis**, and others. That early work is preserved in `/old-progress` as a record of foundational learning and exploration.

After gaining more experience in real-world software development, I am resuming structured DSA practice with a clearer focus and a different primary language.

## Why TypeScript

Current solutions are written in **TypeScript** to better align algorithmic thinking with production-grade software engineering. TypeScript encourages explicit reasoning, clearer data modeling, and disciplined handling of edge cases.

## Structure

- `/old-progress` — earlier solutions (mostly Python)
- Topic-based folders — current work, organized by problem-solving patterns

Each solution documents the pattern used, time/space complexity, and key insight.

This is a continuation, not a restart.
